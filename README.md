---

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Husky34Dev/ollamaWorkbench
cd <repository-folder>
```

### Step 2: Build and Run the App Using Docker Compose
Ensure you have `requirements.txt` properly configured with all necessary dependencies for your Flask app.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This command will:
1. Build the Docker image based on the `Dockerfile-flask`.
2. Install Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Start the Flask application on port `5001`.

### Step 3: Access the App
Once the container is running, you can access the application in your browser at:
```
http://localhost:5001
```
